# Privacy Policy for Arabic-English Text Converter

**Last Updated:** [Replace with today's date]

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Arabic-English Text Converter Chrome extension ("Extension," "we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our browser extension.

## Information We Collect

### Text Conversion Data
- **Local Processing Only**: All text conversion between Arabic and English characters happens locally within your browser. We do not collect, store, or transmit any text content you type or convert.
- **No Text Storage**: Your input text, converted text, or any text content is never sent to our servers or stored anywhere.

### Technical Information
- **Extension Settings**: We store your auto-conversion preference setting locally in your browser's sync storage. This setting determines whether automatic text conversion is enabled or disabled.
- **Browser Permissions**: The extension requires the following permissions:
  - `activeTab`: To access the currently active tab for text conversion functionality
  - `storage`: To save your extension settings (auto-conversion preference)

## How We Use Information

### Text Conversion
- All text conversion is performed locally on your device using character mapping algorithms.
- No text content is transmitted to external servers or services.
- Conversion happens in real-time as you type or paste text.

### Settings Management
- Your auto-conversion preference is stored locally and synced across your Chrome browser instances (if you're signed into Chrome).
- This setting allows you to enable or disable automatic text conversion.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

## Data Security

- All text processing occurs locally within your browser.
- No data is transmitted over the internet.

## Your Rights and Choices

- **Manual Conversion**: Use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+C) for manual conversion when auto-conversion is disabled.
- **Remove Extension**: You can uninstall the extension at any time, which will remove all stored settings.

### Browser Storage
